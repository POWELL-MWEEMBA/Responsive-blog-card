## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

1. How to implement first mobile approach/desgin
2. The differences 100vh/100vw and 100%, where 100vh/vw focs on the viewport of the browser window while 100% depends o nthe parent element to occupy space.

### Continued development

COuld like to include the card in future project

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) - help with the use of 100% and 100vh. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
